NFT Loan and Borrow Platform for Story IP
This project implements a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing against Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that represent ownership of story-based Intellectual Property (IP).

Project Overview
The platform aims to unlock liquidity for creators and owners of story IPs by allowing them to use their NFTs as collateral for loans. Lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity to the platform.

Key Features:
NFT as Collateral: Users can lock their story IP NFTs in smart contracts to borrow stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies.

Loan Origination: Lenders can offer loans with specific terms (interest rate, duration, loan-to-value ratio) or contribute to liquidity pools.

Interest Accrual: Interest is accrued over the loan period, payable by the borrower.

Liquidation: If a borrower defaults on their loan (e.g., fails to repay within the agreed timeframe, or the collateral value drops significantly), the platform allows for the liquidation of the NFT to cover the outstanding debt.

Story IP Focus: The platform is specifically designed for NFTs representing rights to stories, scripts, characters, and other narrative-based intellectual property. This could include:

Movie scripts

Novel manuscripts

Comic book series

Video game storylines

Character rights for merchandising

Story Protocol Integration for Royalty-Backed Repayments: The platform is deeply integrated with Story Protocol, allowing borrowers to use future royalties generated by their IP as a means to repay their loans. This unlocks a powerful new financial tool for creators, enabling them to leverage not just the static value of their NFT, but also its future earning potential.

How it Works (Conceptual Flow)
NFT Minting (External): Creators mint NFTs representing their story IP. These NFTs should ideally contain metadata linking to the actual IP content or legal agreements. For Story Protocol integration, the NFT must be registered with the IPAssetRegistry.

User Registration (Optional): Users might need to register on the platform.

Loan Request (Borrower):

A borrower lists their story IP NFT as collateral.

They specify the desired loan amount and may indicate preferred terms.

Loan Offer (Lender) / Pool Lending:

Peer-to-Peer: Lenders can browse listed NFTs and make direct loan offers with specific interest rates and durations.

Pool-Based: Lenders can deposit funds into liquidity pools, and borrowers can borrow from these pools at algorithmically determined or pre-set interest rates.

Loan Agreement:

If a borrower accepts a lender's offer (or borrows from a pool), a smart contract locks the NFT and disburses the loan amount to the borrower.

The LendingProtocol contract checks if the collateral is a registered Story Protocol IP and stores its storyIpId.

The terms of the loan (principal, interest, maturity date, collateral ID) are recorded on the blockchain.

Standard Repayment:

The borrower repays the loan principal plus accrued interest before or on the maturity date.

Upon successful repayment, the NFT is unlocked and returned to the borrower.

Repayment via Royalties (Story Protocol Integration):

Borrowers who have collateralized a Story Protocol-registered IP can utilize the claimAndRepay function.

This function interacts with the platform's RoyaltyManager contract.

The RoyaltyManager calls Story Protocol's RoyaltyModule to claim any accrued royalties for the specific storyIpId.

These claimed funds are then automatically applied to the outstanding loan balance. If the royalties cover the entire debt, the loan is settled and the collateral is returned. If they cover a partial amount, the borrower is responsible for the remainder.

Default and Liquidation:

If the borrower fails to repay the loan by the maturity date, or if the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceeds a critical threshold, the loan enters a default state.

The locked NFT can then be liquidated. This might involve:

Transferring the NFT to the lender.

Auctioning the NFT to the highest bidder, with proceeds used to cover the debt and any remaining amount (if any) returned to the borrower.

Technical Stack (Anticipated)
Smart Contracts: Solidity for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains.

Development Framework: Foundry

Core Dependencies:

@openzeppelin/contracts for security and standard implementations (ERC721, Ownable).

@storyprotocol/contracts for interfaces to the IIPAssetRegistry and RoyaltyModule.

Frontend: (To be determined - e.g., React, Vue, Angular)

Backend: (To be determined - e.g., Node.js, Python)

NFT Standards: ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for representing story IP.

Project Goals
Provide a secure and transparent platform for NFT-backed loans.

Enable creators to leverage their story IP for funding without selling their rights outright.

Offer attractive returns for lenders willing to provide liquidity.

Foster a new market for valuing and financing creative intellectual property by integrating with Story Protocol's royalty infrastructure.
