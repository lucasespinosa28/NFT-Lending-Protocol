# NFT Loan and Borrow Platform for Story IP

This project implements a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing against Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that represent ownership of story-based Intellectual Property (IP).

## Project Overview

The platform aims to unlock liquidity for creators and owners of story IPs by allowing them to use their NFTs as collateral for loans. Lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity to the platform.

### Key Features:

*   **NFT as Collateral:** Users can lock their story IP NFTs in smart contracts to borrow stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies.
*   **Loan Origination:** Lenders can offer loans with specific terms (interest rate, duration, loan-to-value ratio) or contribute to liquidity pools.
*   **Interest Accrual:** Interest is accrued over the loan period, payable by the borrower.
*   **Liquidation:** If a borrower defaults on their loan (e.g., fails to repay within the agreed timeframe, or the collateral value drops significantly), the platform allows for the liquidation of the NFT to cover the outstanding debt.
*   **Story IP Focus:** The platform is specifically designed for NFTs representing rights to stories, scripts, characters, and other narrative-based intellectual property. This could include:
    *   Movie scripts
    *   Novel manuscripts
    *   Comic book series
    *   Video game storylines
    *   Character rights for merchandising

## How it Works (Conceptual Flow)

1.  **NFT Minting (External):** Creators mint NFTs representing their story IP. These NFTs should ideally contain metadata linking to the actual IP content or legal agreements.
2.  **User Registration (Optional):** Users might need to register on the platform.
3.  **Loan Request (Borrower):**
    *   A borrower lists their story IP NFT as collateral.
    *   They specify the desired loan amount and may indicate preferred terms.
4.  **Loan Offer (Lender) / Pool Lending:**
    *   **Peer-to-Peer:** Lenders can browse listed NFTs and make direct loan offers with specific interest rates and durations.
    *   **Pool-Based:** Lenders can deposit funds into liquidity pools, and borrowers can borrow from these pools at algorithmically determined or pre-set interest rates.
5.  **Loan Agreement:**
    *   If a borrower accepts a lender's offer (or borrows from a pool), a smart contract locks the NFT and disburses the loan amount to the borrower.
    *   The terms of the loan (principal, interest, maturity date, collateral ID) are recorded on the blockchain.
6.  **Repayment:**
    *   The borrower repays the loan principal plus accrued interest before or on the maturity date.
    *   Upon successful repayment, the NFT is unlocked and returned to the borrower.
7.  **Default and Liquidation:**
    *   If the borrower fails to repay the loan by the maturity date, or if the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceeds a critical threshold (due to a decrease in the perceived value of the NFT), the loan enters a default state.
    *   The locked NFT can then be liquidated. This might involve:
        *   Transferring the NFT to the lender.
        *   Auctioning the NFT to the highest bidder, with proceeds used to cover the debt and any remaining amount (if any) returned to the borrower.

## Technical Stack (Anticipated)

*   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains.
*   **Development Framework:** Foundry
*   **Frontend:** (To be determined - e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
*   **Backend:** (To be determined - e.g., Node.js, Python)
*   **NFT Standards:** ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for representing story IP.

## Project Goals

*   Provide a secure and transparent platform for NFT-backed loans.
*   Enable creators to leverage their story IP for funding without selling their rights outright.
*   Offer attractive returns for lenders willing to provide liquidity.
*   Foster a new market for valuing and financing creative intellectual property.
